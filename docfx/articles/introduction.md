# SpeckleUnity - Manual

**SpeckleUnity** is a package used to allow applications build with Unity3D to act as a client to a given Speckle Server.

These manuals asume you already have a base understanding of what Speckle is, what the general workflow is and what the core terminology is so explanations on these topics won't be too in depth. The aim of these articles is to shed light on how the Unity client specifically works, how to use it and what makes it different to the other Speckle clients.
