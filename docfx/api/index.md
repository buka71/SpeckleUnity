# SpeckleUnity - Scripting API
This section of the documentation contains details of the API that SpeckleUnity provides. To use this information, you should be familiar with the basic theory and practice of developing with SpeckleUnity which is explained in the **Manual** tab.

This scripting API reference is organised according to the classes available to scripts which are described along with their methods, properties and any other information relevant to their use.

APIs are grouped by the namespaces they belong to, and can be selected from the sidebar to the left. For most users, the `SpeckleUnity` section will be the main port of call.
